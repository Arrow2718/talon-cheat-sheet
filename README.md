Talon Voice Commands Cheatsheet


1. Have talon installed and running on your computer following the instructions at [talonvoice.com](https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html#getting-started)
2. Have this repo cloned  into the user directory of ~/talon.  This makes these scripts available to talon.
3. Say "print cheatsheet" or "mark cheatsheet" first produces an html second produces an individual markdown file for every context 
4. Open the talon repl and type

```
actions.user.cheatsheet()
actions.user.cheatsheet_md()
```
Can easily convert the html to pdf with a browser although I prefer pandoc or weasyprint.
